# portfolio-sample-with-materialize-css

A portfolio, in a general sense, is a collection of drawings, documents, etc. that represent a person's, especially an artist's, work.

A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. It's one of the most practical and memorable ways to share your work with the press, potential collaborators, or employers.

This sample uses the common trend of nav - hero image/message - projects - contact - footer as a guide.
